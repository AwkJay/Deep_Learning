## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries Used

The solutions are implemented using Python 3 and rely on the following core libraries:

* **Numerical & Data Handling:**
    * `NumPy`
    * `Pandas`
* **Deep Learning Frameworks:**
    * `PyTorch`
    * `TensorFlow` (with the Keras backend)
* **NLP & Transformer Libraries:**
    * `Hugging Face Transformers`
    * `Hugging Face Diffusers`
* **Machine Learning & Visualization:**
    * `Scikit-learn`
    * `Matplotlib`
    * `Seaborn`
* **Explainable AI:**
    * `LIME`

## ‚ö° How to Run

The assignments are in the form of Jupyter/Google Colab notebooks (`.ipynb` files).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AwkJay/Deep_Learning.git](https://github.com/AwkJay/Deep_Learning.git)
    ```
2.  **Open in Google Colab:** Once the notebooks are uploaded, the easiest way to run them will be to open them directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3.  **Dependencies:** Any special libraries required for a specific notebook (like `diffusers` or `lime`) are typically installed at the beginning of the notebook file with a `!pip install ...` command.
